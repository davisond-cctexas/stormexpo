                    Prep Your Home for Hurricane Season
-   Review your insurance policies
o   Make sure your policy covers the full cost of rebuilding if home is lost in the storm
o   Some policies ensure the cost of the home, but not the cost to rebuild

-   Consider flood insurance
o   Many insurance policies cover damages to a home, but not damage caused by flooding

-   Take an inventory of your property
o   Document possessions to have an accurate document of what you own
o   Find out what types of items are and are not covered by insurance
o   Taking a video, making a list with estimated cost/value will help expedite the claim process

-   Secure and seal your roof
o   Inspect roof to make sure all shingles or tiles are secured

-   Add roof straps
o   Metal roof straps can be used to attach the roof to the walls of your house 

-   Secure porches and carports
o   A porch or a carport can potentially tear a hole in your house
o   Porches and carports which are attached to your home must be firmly anchored in the ground

-   Seal windows and doors
o   Seals around doors and windows must be checked, especially in hot weather
o   Without sealants, rain blowing in sideways can quickly get inside your home

-   Seal holes
o   Holes used to attach electrical wires to a house should be sealed using caulk to keep rain out

-   Clear the lawn
o   Any items left in your lawn can become a powerful projectile during a storm
o   Lawn furniture, barbeque grills, garden items (hoses, plants, pots) should be stored or secured

-   Reinforce your garage door
o   Garage doors often get blown in and can tear a house apart
o   A vertical garage door brace and horizontal wooden beams will help stormproof a garage door
What About My Boat?
    Glad you asked! Here are a few tips on getting your boat ready.
•   Remove as much rigging, canvas, and deck gear as possible.

•   If your boat is staying in the water during a storm, remove heavy items from the stern area, such as anchors, extra fuel tanks, and motors.

•   Close all but the cockpit drains and plug the engine’s exhaust port.

•   Use masking or duct tape to seal around hatches, ports, and lockers to keep water from getting below.

•   Small boats should be covered if possible.

•   Boats are nearly always safer when hauled ashore as opposed to left docked in the water.

•   Smaller boats should be placed on their trailer and taken inland.

•   Do not park boats under trees that might be blown over or lose large limbs.

•   If you take your boat home, place it, and not your car, in the garage because a boat is lighter and more vulnerable to high winds than a car.

•   Place your boat on a trailer and move it inland as early as possible as traffic may become very heavy in anticipation of a storm.

•   A marina with no protection from the storm’s winds and waves is going to suffer much greater damage than one that is tucked away. Boats in unprotected arenas should be moved inland.

•   When a storm is a substantial possibility, plan to move your boat inland before bridges are closed or the marina is too busy to secure and haul your vessel.
